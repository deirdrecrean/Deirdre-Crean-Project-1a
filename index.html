    <h2>Why Airports?</h2>
    <p class="para">There are so many references to Airports in Pop Culture. It is such a weird place full of symbolism and importance for so many of us, yet it is often overlooked when we are in the place itself. Still, many songwriters take time waiting for a plane or while on a plane as a time of reflection, and often emerge from their travels with some great songs. To reflect upon that, this is a collection of songs that either mention airports or were written in airports.</p>

    <h2 class=s ong>Leaving On a Jet Plane</h2>
    <p>By John Denver</p>
    <div class=l yrics>

        <p> All my bags are packed I'm ready to go
            <br> I'm standin' here outside your door
            <br> I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
            <br> But the dawn is breakin' it's early morn
            <br> The taxi's waitin' he's blowin' his horn
            <br> Already I'm so lonesome I could die
            <br>
        </p>

        <p>So kiss me and smile for me
            <br> Tell me that you'll wait for me
            <br> Hold me like you'll never let me go
            <br> Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane
            <br> Don't know when I'll be back again
            <br> Oh baby, I hate to go</p>

        <p>There's so many times I've let you down
            <br> So many times I've played around
            <br> I tell you now, they don't mean a thing
            <br> Every place I go, I'll think of you
            <br> Every song I sing, I'll sing for you
            <br> When I come back, I'll bring your wedding ring</p>

        <p>So kiss me and smile for me
            <br> Tell me that you'll wait for me
            <br> Hold me like you'll never let me go
            <br> Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane
            <br> Don't know when I'll be back again
            <br> Oh babe, I hate to go</p>

        <p>Now the time has come to leave you
            <br> One more time let me kiss you
            <br> Close your eyes I'll be on my way
            <br> Dream about the days to come
            <br> When I won't have to leave alone
            <br> About the times, I won't have to say</p>

        <p>So kiss me and smile for me
            <br> Tell me that you'll wait for me
            <br> Hold me like you'll never let me go
            <br> Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane
            <br> Don't know when I'll be back again
            <br> Oh baby, I hate to go</p>

        <p>Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane
            <br> Don't know when I'll be back again
            <br> Oh baby, I hate to go</p>

    <h2 class="song">Mira From Manhattan</h2>

    <p>by Jacob Derwin</p>
    <div class="lyrics">
        <p>Her name is Mira from Manhattan
            <br> Her name is Chelsea from Chelsea
            <br> Her name is Christa from Columbus
            <br> It doesn’t matter much to me</p>

        <p>And now she’s staring out the window
            <br> And now she’s turning on the night
            <br> She takes a pen to her new novel
            <br> And the airplane takes flight</p>

        <p>Mmm I never knew… you…</p>

        <p>And now we’re flying out to Dublin
            <br> Just a stop along the trail
            <br> Mira hops from there to Paris
            <br> I ride to Belfast on the rail</p>

        <p>Now she’s cheering in the winery
            <br> Now I’m looking ‘cross(at) the sea
            <br> Her name is Mira from Manhattan
            <br> It doesn’t matter much to me</p>

        <p>Mmm I never knew… you…</p>
