<h2 class="song">Leaving On a Jet Plane</h2>
    <div class= lyrics>
        <p>By John Denver</p>
<p> All my bags are packed I'm ready to go<br>
I'm standin' here outside your door<br>
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye<br>
But the dawn is breakin' it's early morn<br>
The taxi's waitin' he's blowin' his horn<br>
    Already I'm so lonesome I could die<br></p>

<p>So kiss me and smile for me<br>
Tell me that you'll wait for me<br>
Hold me like you'll never let me go<br>
Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane<br>
Don't know when I'll be back again<br>
    Oh baby, I hate to go</p>

<p>There's so many times I've let you down<br>
So many times I've played around<br>
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing<br>
Every place I go, I'll think of you<br>
Every song I sing, I'll sing for you<br>
    When I come back, I'll bring your wedding ring</p>

<p>So kiss me and smile for me<br>
Tell me that you'll wait for me<br>
Hold me like you'll never let me go<br>
Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane<br>
Don't know when I'll be back again<br>
Oh babe, I hate to go</p>

<p>Now the time has come to leave you<br>
One more time let me kiss you<br>
Close your eyes I'll be on my way<br>
Dream about the days to come<br>
When I won't have to leave alone<br>
About the times, I won't have to say</p>

<p>So kiss me and smile for me<br>
Tell me that you'll wait for me<br>
Hold me like you'll never let me go<br>
Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane<br>
Don't know when I'll be back again<br>
    Oh baby, I hate to go</p>

<p>Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane<br>
Don't know when I'll be back again<br>
Oh baby, I hate to go</p>

    <h2 class="song">Mira From Manhattan</h2>
    
    <p>by Jacob Derwin</p>
<div class= "lyrics">
    <p>Her name is Mira from Manhattan <br>
Her name is Chelsea from Chelsea <br>
Her name is Christa from Columbus<br>
It doesn’t matter much to me</p>

<p>And now she’s staring out the window<br>
And now she’s turning on the night<br>
She takes a pen to her new novel<br>
And the airplane takes flight</p>

<p>Mmm I never knew… you…</p>

<p>And now we’re flying out to Dublin<br>
Just a stop along the trail<br>
Mira hops from there to Paris<br>
I ride to Belfast on the rail</p>

<p>Now she’s cheering in the winery<br>
Now I’m looking ‘cross(at) the sea<br>
Her name is Mira from Manhattan<br>
It doesn’t matter much to me</p>

<p>Mmm I never knew… you…</p>
